# Web Server Security Monitoring with Splunk

## Objective
Implement a Splunk-based security solution to monitor and detect potential security incidents in web server logs.

## Project Overview
Design and configure Splunk to ingest and analyze web server logs, create dashboards for real-time monitoring, set up alerts for suspicious activities, and develop an incident response playbook.

## Steps

### Data Ingestion

1. Use Splunk Forwarders to collect web server logs.
2. Configure the `inputs.conf` file on the forwarder to specify the location of web server logs.


### Dashboard Creation:

1. Navigate to the Splunk dashboard creation interface.
Add panels for log trends, security incidents, and real-time alerts related to web server logs.
2. Customize visualizations, such as line charts showing request trends, tables displaying IP addresses, and gauges indicating error rates.

### Search Queries:

1. Access the Splunk Search & Reporting app.
2. Utilize SPL to create search queries specific to web server logs.
   >Example query: index=web_logs sourcetype=access_logs status=50* | stats count by clientip

### Incident Detection:

1. Set up alerts in Splunk for critical events, such as HTTP 500 errors.
2. Configure email notifications for triggered alerts.
   >Example alert condition: index=web_logs sourcetype=access_logs status=50* | stats count by status | where status > 10

### Threat Hunting:

1. Use ad-hoc searches to hunt for potential threats.
2. Example query: index=web_logs sourcetype=access_logs error | table clientip, uri_path

### Incident Response:

1. Develop an incident response playbook for web server-related incidents.
2. Include steps for investigating abnormal patterns, identifying compromised IP addresses, and mitigating potential threats.

### Integration:

1. Integrate Splunk with a SIEM tool for comprehensive security monitoring.
2. Configure Splunk to ingest logs from firewall and IDS systems.

### Reporting:

1. Navigate to the Splunk reporting interface.
2. Create reports summarizing security incidents detected in web server logs.
3. Example report: A monthly overview of top web server security incidents.  can you make the whole thing to code so i can out on my fethub

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust security solution using Splunk, showcasing my skills in log management, threat detection, and incident response.
